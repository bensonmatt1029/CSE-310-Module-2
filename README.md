# Overview

I developed a console-based Employee Management System in C# to improve my understanding of the language. The program handles basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for managing employee data. Users can add employees by entering details like name, position, and ID, edit existing employee information, view all employees, and delete records. The system uses object-oriented programming to organize employee details in a class and includes loops, conditionals, and functions to manage user input and data efficiently.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to write and test the C# code, and the .NET SDK to build and run the application. Visual Studio Code made coding easier with helpful features like IntelliSense.

I chose C# because it's great for object-oriented programming and reliable for building software. The program used the basic .NET Standard Library for handling input, output, and managing data.

# Future Work

-Input Validation: Enhance input handling to prevent errors, such as checking for non-integer values for IDs.

-Search Functionality: Implement a feature to search for employees by name or position.

-Data Persistence: Add functionality to save and load employee data from a file or database, ensuring data is retained between program runs.
